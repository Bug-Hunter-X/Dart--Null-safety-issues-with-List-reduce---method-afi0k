# Dart Null Safety Issue with List.reduce()

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Dart when working with lists containing nullable values. The `reduce` method throws an exception if it encounters a `null` value.  This example showcases the problem and offers a safe solution using the `fold` method. 

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code using `reduce`.  The `bugSolution.dart` demonstrates a safer approach using `fold`. 

## Solution
The `fold` method provides more control, allowing you to specify an initial value and handle `null` values appropriately, avoiding potential exceptions.
